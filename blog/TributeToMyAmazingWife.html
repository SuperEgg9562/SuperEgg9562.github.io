        <h4>For my amazing Wife</h4>
        <p>Although I said many dangerous words toward you. My love has never changed.</p>
        <p>Although I can not change the past. I still choose to love you.</p>
        <p>My words may have harmed you. But they will never rule you.</p>
        <p>My actions may not have lined up with the word. But GOD will change them.</p>
        <p>I hurt you and there is no excuse. I was wrong. I was weak. </p>
        <p>I am not without blemish, in truth I am covered in them.</p>
        <p>When I said you were my sunshine, I meant it.</p>
        <p>When I said my vows I meant EVERY ONE.</p>
        <p>Even in bad times I choose you.</p>
        <p>Even now when hope is but a distant light, I choose you.</p>
