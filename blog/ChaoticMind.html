        <h3>The Chaos of my Mind</h3>
        <h4>16th September 2020</h4>
        <p> When you follow Jesus you get attacked daily by Satan and his
             minions. This is highly annoying, as you get more than the lords
            voice when you pray. What Ive learned to do is this; When a 
           voice says anything, I weigh it against scripture. If it does not
          line up, I rebuke the voice with Jesus and continue. 
        </p>
        <p> Jesus spoke this to me when I was feeling pretty pitiful
           inside: " I amnawakening you to your best you-the you that I have 
          planned and dreamed of before the foundation of the world.
         You have been through a purging time and a sifting time. You have
        been so discouraged and have been feeling like you have been
       stagnating. However, the opposite is true! You are not stagnating;
      you are beginning to bear fruit! For so long, you have served me humbly.
     You have served my people, and you have walked as much as you could in 
    what I called you to do. You have blossomed and you have grown, but you
   havent known what to do when your blossoms appeared to fall off.
  </p>   
  <p>
     But my beloved, the blossom was never the goal. You have been 
    mistaking your blossoming for your fruit, when in fact blossoming
   comes quite awhile before fruit! And blossoming is fun, but oh!
    The wildness of the Joy that is Fruit! My child, you have never 
     really been the way of fruit before. Oh, you have borne fruit in 
      your character. You have birthed godly ftuit through and despite 
     hardship. But a season of fruit-a whole, entire season? Never gave you
    ever been in a season of bearing fruit before; you have only been in a
   season of blossoming! But you need to know, beloved that the ftuit 
    comes after the deathbof the bloom. You have to understand this in order
     to stay encouraged. And although it looks like the death of the bloom
    is the end of beauty in your life, in reality it is only the beginning
   of hope and prosperity. 
  </p>
  <p> I love you, my child. I am so proud of you! I delight in you. 
     Faithfull you have finished the season of blooming. 
    You have endured the death of the bloom and the hardship that comes
     after the bloom dies. Faithfully you have hung on, believing me and
      trusting in me despite the feelings of loss and betrayal, and 
       abandonment. Faithfully, my child, you have clung to the truth that I 
      am with you always, even unto the end of the age. And faithfully, you 
     have chosen to live on and fight another day, even when your back
      has been against a wall and you didnt know how you were going to make
       it through. 
    </p>
    <p> You are now in a season of awakening and of fruit. I have moved you 
       into this new season; you felt and saw it manifest a week ago, and this 
      season will never end. Once a fruit tree matures and begins bearing fruit, 
     it never gets less mature. Likewise, you have crossed threshold into a season of 
    fruitfulness that will never regress or go backward. I have 
     ordained your awakening. So many things had to be surrendered to
      me, but you have surrendered them. The most recent things were
       actually some of the hardest, but you have grown so much and I have
      helped you so much that the hardest things fell away easier than the
     easiest things. Take that as evidence that thus word is for you, 
    beloved. Things you never thought possible will become possible in
     this season. Things you never thought would happen will happen in a 
      good way. Things you never knew you could do will suddenly become
     available to you to do them. I am a river within you. Follow me as I
    lead you. Hear me as I woo you. In this season of awakening and 
   might, dont worry about how you are going to get things done.
    Simply rest, be diligent, and look at me. I will flow through you
    like water to accomplish my plans and purposes for you as you 
     obey me. I love you, my child. I am with you always, even unto
      the end of the world. Love, Dad."      
  </p>
  <P> This word was sent sent to me by God through his disciple: 
     Jamie Rohrbaugh. Its interesting to me that God used a women with 
    that first name to get my attention. God has spoken through Jamie R 
   more than once. God is never wrong so I listened when he said stand
  for your marriage. Do not break apart what I have made. This is why I
 have not just walked away.
