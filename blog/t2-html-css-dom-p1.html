        	<p>
          	What is Html? Well, to me my friends html provides the building blocks of a page,
          		it's very much like building a house or building a boat or maybe even a car.
          			Html provides the structure for a page, much like the framing, walls, floors,
          				roof, doors pipe-work and electronic wiring provide the structure for the
          					basis of constructing a house.Html tags and combinations of these are what
          						form the structure. Eg. The div tag can be liken to the walls of a house
          							it divides the different rooms.
        									</p>
        										<p>
          										What is Css? Well, to me my friends css provides the style for a page,
          											its liken to the colors, all the visul effects that make up a house's
          												skin, its look and feel. Css does the visual effects for a page that a
           													interior-designer and painter does for a house.
        															</p>
        														<p>
          												What is the DOM? Well the dom is the model for a page, much like the
          											architectural desgin of a house. It helps the browser to visually represent
          										a page much like the architectural desgin of a house represents the
          									visual outcome of a to be constructed house. A brain(Dom) probably is more
          								concise, as it stores the information of Html/Css and its electrical
          							messages(Browser) render the page correctly according
          						to the Html amd Css.
        						</p>

				<div class="col-12 end"><div class="boxify"><h2 class="explanation2">Boxifying Design</h2>
      <p>
    Elements on a web-page can be contained within a rectangle, ie. A box.
 	Boxifying is where you take all the elements of a web-page design and divide it up
accordingly into different sized boxes. The title of a web-page is a great
  example, draw a even-sided rectangle around the title and there you have it,
    the title has been "Boxified". Even the page itself is geometric in design, essentially
      its a big box/rectangle.
        To see these boxes as a developer, we use a piece of code in our css
        	and this helps us to see them more easily. It also helps with structuring
          	the page aswell.

												<div class="col-12 end"><div class="box-model"><h2 class="explanation3">The Box Model</h2>
        									<p>
          									The Box Model is/can be defined in several key areas within and without.
        											</p>
        												<ul>
          												<li>Margin: The space between this specific box and other boxes</li>
          													<li>Border: The actual perimeter of the box</li>
          												<li>Padding: The space between the content and border of the box, acts like like a buffer of sorts</li>
          											<li>Content: The actual stuff/content thats inside at the centre of the box</li>
        											</ul>
        										<p>
													Css properties can allow us to set the values of padding,margin and border values.
												</p>
											<p>
										There are several ways that we can adjust the size of a box through use of the box-sizing property.
          				Here are some ways to do this:
        				</p>
        			<ul>
          	<li>The Content Box: The Default value of the box-sizing value, includes only the content of the box using height and width. Excludes the  padding, border and margin properties.</li>
          <li>The Border Box: The properties to be adjusted include: content, padding and border using height and width. Exludes the Margin property. </li>
				</ul>
			<p>
		Dev tools in "Google Chrome" can be used to test some of these properties.
