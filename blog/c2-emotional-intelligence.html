    Emotional Intelligence; What a giant subject. I just read chapter 1 of
    "Search Inside Your-self" and Wow, Its amazing. This has taught me more
    about myself than anything Ive previously tried. I didn't realise that
    you could be a lot better at being kind and happy and all the trimmings LoL.
    But you can and it's done by training. I struggle to put this into words.
    But I feel relaxed and happy, not mind-blocked most of the time. It's a
    great feeling.
