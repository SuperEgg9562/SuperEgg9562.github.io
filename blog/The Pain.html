        <h1>It Hurts</h1>
        <p>As I lie on my bed instantly I remember the love I had
         for my wife. It was wholly from the bottom of my heart and my entire 
         being. It hurts so bad. Miss her extremely. Its painful, Im a complete 
         mess and Im crying. What do I do with this unrealised love. 
         How do I continue. One step at time. Write, express my pain 
         openly. Dont hide it anymore. Its almost unbearable, Im 
         struggling second by second. How? Just how? I dont even 
         know where to start. Broken and falling apart. Why does this 
         hurt so much? Why dont I hate her? It hurts, it hurts, it hurts. 
         Man I wish I didnt hurt this much. I wish things were different. 
         But they are not. And now I got to step up and be myself more 
         than ever. This is the worst experience of my life.
         Its sickening to know how badly she has hurt me. It was 
         stupid to think she was different. I let my guard down and got 
         burnt. I changed aspects of myself and it was never good enough. 
         Why am I never good enough. Why does it always end in heart break.
         My insides hurt, I feel cold. I feel unwanted. I feel betrayed.
         I gave all of myself to her. But it was not enough. I gave up 
         everything bar my life even though I tried. Im tired of hurting. 
         Im tired of giving everything and not receiving the same in return. 
         Im tired of being used up and discarded. Im tired of being hurt.          </p>
