        <h3>When God Fights</h3>
        <h4>21st September 2020</h4>
        <p>  Today I was dealing with more attacks from the unseen. I have my
        two boys staying, they go home tonight. The attacks start 3 days before
        they arrive, 3 days after, 2 days at random and 1 day for in no particular 
        time frame for no reason. Either way I'm still standing, why? Jesus is
        the why.
        </p> 
        <h3>Seeking Salvation From The Enemy</h3>
        <p> When you live and breathe Jesus, all your faults, your mistakes
        and your past is used to bring you back to sin.
        My past is Chaotic at best, but it is just my past. I have been 
        forgiven for all I did badly. Satan on the other hand wants me
        to remain there. Why? Because he wants me not to speak about my God,
        and how he saved me. He wants me to remain isolated from others so
        that I can't speak. Everyday the lords armies battle before my waking
        eyes just on the edge of my perception. I have always seen demons for
        what they are, the illusions of the Fallen agents of discord. I can
        see them as clearly as I see you. Its not a nice site. The Light side
        are different than what you would expect. Some are heavily armored while
        others are wearing an assortment of garments. I watch as they repeated 
        drive back attack after attack. The weakest link is not the lords armies
        but the human general whose mind is in turmoil. Jesus always just appears
        in blinding light standing in front of me rebuking back the onslaught.
        It's comforting to know when I'm not relying on him, he steps in and 
        reminds me. Thats when satan loses and runs.
        </p>
        <p> Jesus is the way. Only through him do I win anything. I get all
        things from christ our god. There is much I have learned. In Christ 
        I can forgive everything. Because of  Jesus I can let go of it all.
        </p>
        <p> I read my bible every moment I have free, Why? I am keeping the
        unspoken covenant I made with christ on my day of salvation, the 
        reaffirming of it on my wedding day and the reaffirming I made
        at separation. Keeping my covenants with Jesus will keep me separate
        from sin. I will not remarry another woman or even date. That was a 
        I made my wife in front of God. I intend to keep. I will keep his laws,
        not the laws of man who have hardened their hearts. For it is said in 
        malachi that God hates divorce and I must honor my wife of my youth.
        There is no exception, divorce is man-made, it is not from God. Jesus
        explains this when speaking to the pharasees.
        Satan wants me to break this covenant. I will not.
        Divorce hurts for generations, not just the two people involved.
