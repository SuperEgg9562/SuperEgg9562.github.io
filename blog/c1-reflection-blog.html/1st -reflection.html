            <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>

    <p>
    The DBC/EDA experince is just choice! Real cool, so inspiring. I can't wait to meet everyone.
    People come from different walks of life, differnet cultures and backgrounds etc. But the way the DBC/EDA
    seek to teach is just amazing. I like that you promote kindness. I like that you encourage. I like that you
    say its a journey not a destination. It's very comforting to know that I will not be alone in this journey.
    The Video blew my mind, got me amped and made me want to to be a part of this.This will be a GREAT experience.
