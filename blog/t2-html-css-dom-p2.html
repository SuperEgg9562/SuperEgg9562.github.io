      </h2>
    <div>
  <p>
Grids! Are a cool property defined in html that allows us to create more complex
  boxes. They allow us to structure our web-pages. Boxifying a web-page is a lot easier
    when there is a grid because the grid itself is essentially multiple boxes strung together
      to make what we call a grid.They help with the placement of content. And most websites follow
        a grid based design based on our natural tendency to follow its simple yet effective design flow.

        </h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              People access the internet from various devices, like smart-phones, tablets and pc.
                All these devices use a different sized screen to show the same content, by screen I mean its
                  resolution normally expressed in pixels.Responsive design is as simple as changing the size to fit,
                    which pretty much is what I mean by responsive design.

      <h2 class="fourth-title">Sematic Tags: What Are These?
    </h2>
  <div>
<p>
  Semantic tags help the browser to understand what its seeing in a html document.
    They also help us to understand whats in a html doc. These tags help us to know
      where to put our content. They kind of help a page to make sense.
        For example: h1 is a semantic tag that tells us and the browser that this is a
          heading, more importantly is type 1 heading, meaning that it shoulld be larger
            than say a h2 which is another semantic of lesser status than a h1. If you compare
              a h1 tag to a 'title' in a book it would make more sense that h1 tags are the first
                heading we see on a Web-page.
