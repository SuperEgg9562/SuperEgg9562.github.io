        <h1>What Now?</h1>
        <p>Now What? Do I go the complete opposite of the norm? Do I study
         and become my dream? What I do know is Im at a turning point in my 
         life and I can go a number of ways. First up is facing my past 
         and moving one step foward. I have been hurt beyond words to 
         explain thoroughly. Its a hard pill to swallow realising that 
         my once best friend could deal such a dangerous blow. Its like having 
         your insides ripped apart by an immense destructive internal 
         force. And for what was the purpose of hurting me so bad that 
         in my mind death was the only way to escape the pain felt? 
         All or nothing. This has been my approach for as long as I can 
         remember. Im not sure why it seemed to me there was only two ways 
         to go. I do know there is more than two ways. There is an in-between. 
         I can choose feel a certain way. I have free choice. I am the one 
         who controls how I feel, so the things that happen out of my control 
         are not my responsibility unless I make them mine. So to be hurt 
         for so long was a choice I had made unwittingly. I miss my two boys. 
         I think this will as hard as make it.</p>
