  <h1>Time And Habits</h1>


 <h2> 23 October 2017 </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Meditation</li>
     <li>Growth Mindset</li>
      <li>Starting Small</li>
       <li>Creating Tiny Habits</li>
        <li>Working On My Flow</li>
         <li>Changing My Behaviour</li>
          </ul>
 <h3>Interesting Finds</h3>
  <p>
  I found all these concepts helped me grow personally and professionally. I learn't that by doing at least one of these
  concepts at least once a day, I was able to grow more productive and able to trouble-shoot more complex coding problems with
  a lot more success than normal. Really cool and interesting. I will continue to do these small changes until they become habits.
  </p>
 <h4>What worked?</h4>
  <p>
  All of the above mentioned worked for me. And they continue to work, I found that listening to my fav songs
  actually increased my output ten-fold. I'm more relaxed and content, happy, less stressed and vitalised individual
  because of these simple changes.
  </p>
 <h5>Experimentation</h5>
  <p>
  Meditation. Clear thinking and focus is a must, by practising more meditation I hope to gain more ground in this particular area.
