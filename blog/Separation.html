      <h1>Separation</h1>
        <p>For a very long time, a year to be exact.... I was very 
        uncomfortable with the divorce. I was so upset and angry with
        all that was going on and being powerless to stop it. 
        eventually I got to the point that I saw suicide as the only 
        option to stop my pain and inner turmoil. I loved my wife and kids 
        so much I could not see a way forward and attempted to take my own 
        life. All it did was confirm some very humbling facts I was too 
        stubborn to see. My wife no longer loved me like I loved her. She
         blamed me for a lot of things, and took no responsibility for her 
         part in it. And was intent on trying to take a moral high ground 
         to justify her actions there-after. I was naturally confused at 
         first and believed most things she told me. But it soon became 
         clear that both of us were hurting and only one of us was bearing 
         the full weight of the marriage and its destruction. 
         While I struggled with the loss of my kids and my best friend 
         I started to notice some huge flaws in my soon to be ex-wife. 
         Despite this I chose to ignore my senses and fought bitterly 
         to no avail to save my marriage. In the end it was an 
         exercise in self discovery that alerted me to the major flaws 
         my marriage had evolved into. I was essentially trapped in the fact 
         that my best friend was extremely self-serving and cared not for 
         the consequences of her actions where as I had become evidently 
         aware of my own flaws abd their impact on the marriage. It 
         was humbling to say in the least. I was angry at god, at my best 
         friend and at myself. Anyway my inability to give some of the 
         blame to my wife led to all sorts of problems. It made me into 
         a slave to her will and I would often clash with my own personality
          to save my relationship. This constant wanting to do right at my 
          own expense led to my eventual attempt. I finally had to admit 
          to myself it had become unhealthy for me to maintain contact of 
          any sort with her, and the way forward was distance and complete 
          cutting of ties with her for a time at least until I no longer 
          loved her so deeply. It was scary at first and is still unsettling 
          to know I did all I could to change for someone who really did 
          not love me like I loved her, and made excuse upon excuse for the 
          justification of her actions. I still hurt now and will probably 
          still hurt for a long time. But I am ok and I will be better man 
          for it. She can no longer hurt me as Im fully aware of who I am 
          and Im not my past rather Im going to be what I choose to be as 
          the future is available to those who seek it. It seems I am at 
          a crossroads in life and thats ok. I can get through this as 
          I have wonderfull friends and family who are in my corner and will
           not abandon me while I walk this path.</p>
