        <h4>Life In The Dark Before Christ</h4>
        <h4>Walking With My Head Down</h4>
        <p>For a very long time before I met Christ in spirit,</p>
        <p>I was living a life of ups and downs. I got most of</p>
        <p>what I deemed necessary to survive and I was relatively</p>
        <p>happy with my lot. I experienced disappointment quite</p>
        <p>often, but it never got me down. I spent the better </p>
        <p>part of my teenage years with a stable, dependable </p>
        <p>group of friends. I was 17 when I first fell in love</p>
        <p>and I was part time, going on to full time apprenticeship</p>
        <p>in flooring. M5 boss was a good man who taught me that</p>
        <p>flooring was an art. I took his 2ords seriously and when</p>
        <p>I screwed up my chance that he gave me I broke.</p>
        <p>Partly because I had failed in two previous relationships</p>
        <p>during my apprenticeship, but also because I had actually</p>
        <p>failed my boss in a number of things.</p>
        <p>Mostly it was the relationships. I did not know how to be</p>
        <p>myself in them. I was always changing to make others happy</p>
        <p>while I lost a piece of myself every time it was demanded.</p> 
        <p>It pushed me into being obsessed with perfection in everything.</p> 
        <p>Now I was good at everything I wanted to try. Thats where I</p> 
        <p>developed arrogance. When I eventually failed at something I</p> 
        <p>deemed myself not perfect and spiralled into depression quite often.</p>
        <p>This setva new belief in me. To fail at anything was to be imperfect.</p> 
        <p>I am the hardest critic of myself. Now the relationships Ive had did 
          some extreme damage to my psyche. I gave low self esteem. My body is 
          ugly. Im ugly. Im unlovable. People hate me. Im a victim. I am broken. 
          About the only thing true in all of this is this; every female I have 
          loved, has tried to change me, has left me when things are tough, have 
          spread mis-information or even just plain false beliefs about me to 
          who-ever would listen and have not told the whole truth about the 
          situations to justify there actions. In essence it has all broken me to
          the point where now, I cant even speak openly about my thoughts because 
          of the sjw type attack you for being male and being a victim of other 
          peoples actions. Its destroyed my confidence in my abilities. And its 
          created a picture where Im the bad guy rather than two people screwed up
          an didnt fix it period.
        <p>This sort of thing has happened to me my whole life, but I continue 
          to see the best in others and forgive them when they screw up. What I 
          did do wrong time and again was keep a record of wrongs, fight unfairly
          and use my mouth for evil when I hit rock bottom. I did this with 
          marriage quite often. It had to change.
</p>
<h4>Enter The Christ</h4>
<p>
I came to the cross when I drunk drove one stormy night in wangnui. All I remeber clearly is this insanely loud STOP!! My dad and brother picked me up and drove me home. My brother had no licence at the time. He got in trouble to rescue me from myself. I quit my job that morning and went to church. I was prayed over and I gave it all up for christ.
I began to recover and tightly gripped my bible everyday. Then the voices. At first I thought the voices were mine trying to make sense of all the hurt I had endured. But turns out I lit the cosmos wit a bright red beacon to satan. My bible became my safe place. Ive fought against him since becoming free. Its never been easy and I find Im powerless against him. But then something interesting happened, he stopped and I did not know how. Turns out he doesnt stop but gets more sinister and crafty. Now I needed a change, just so happens a job with friends came magically out of no-where and I moved up to town called Waitoa. I grew in my walk with christ here. I started to go to a church in the bigger town Morrinsville. It was good here and I became stable again.
</p>
<h4>Small Group And Marriage</h4>
<p>I was going to church and ran into an old mate who kept telling me to join a digs group. So checked with the bible and sure enough small groups was something I should do. Now the one I attended had someone I was to meet there. So as usual I strolled on up, offered my apologies for being late, tgen wham like my eyes had a will of there own snapped to a beautiful young vet nurse who up until now I never knew existed. God said to me in that moment this is your wife, go and sit beside her. So I did. and I was like a little boy in my mind after that. I kept sneaking a look at her trying to suss her out. I found I was extremely attracted to this young woman. After that night I didnt see her again for two weeks. Next time I saw her I was pouring my heart out to this group, we spoke briefly and I left a little earlier. Then some time had passed not sure how much, but she randomly approached me at church and we ended up having lunch and a very in-depth talk. We exchanged numbers here I think. Now she had my full attention. I let down some walls so I could get to know her then wham they all fell. But it was not all roses when we first were getting our feet she did something that nearly broke me before we had even dated properly. She chose to go to see another guy who wanted only sex from her according to her, when that same night I had asked if she wanted to stay with me. This actually broke my heart the first time, as I felt this other guy was more important than me. She turned up the next day proud of herself that she didnt sleep with him according to her, I have no way of verifying if it was truth, because Im not her. It made me feel neglected and not good enough, but the happiness in her voice allowed me to forgive the instance, but it still hurt because the night before when I had asked for her company and got a no, something in already knew what she was going to say tge next day. It hurt so bad I didnt recover for some time and I stopped trusting her because of it. So fast forward a bit I was convinced to marry her. So I took her to look at jewellery, found her favourite and made a plan to propose. Up to this point we had very little conflict as we did not live together. All I wanted was to be with her. I could sit and stare at her for ages on end. I loved her immeasureably. Now we had little disagreements but always managed to wirknit out somehow. Backtrack a bit I remember a time we went to goat island. My future wife was smoking hot in her bikini. I loved it. I was hooked on her. I wanted to shout it everyway, sometimes I did, not a care in the world. Back to presentpast. So we had dog, his name was koda. I decided to pick my girl up for a walk and a play with koda at the lake in HTown. When it was time I tried to get koda to sit, not easy lol. And I got down on my knee and asked her to be my sunshine with a ring in my hands. She shakly almost cried her yes. I loved her deeper than anyone Id ever known. I believed she was my soul mate. The day came fast but was hard fought as the pressure git to us both. But it didnt break us. As she walked down that aisle, I started to cry, she was stunningly beautiful. When we cut the cake I wanted to be gone and just with her. Nothing else mattered, just her. We had our honeymoon at cooks beach at a friends batch. That night was the best night of my life, she was my wife and I wanted only her. We connected on a level that was indescribable. We even got tattoos in thames afterwards. She was my life. Then reality hit as I went back to work. I was stressed to breaking point in my line of work and I brought it home to my innocent wife.<a href="http://www.getskeleton.com">Skeleton documentation</a>.</p>
