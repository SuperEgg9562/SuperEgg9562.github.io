        <h3>Turning Point</h3>
        <h4>Wednesday 16Th of September</h4>
        <p> Ive cried a lot these last 10 and a half months, so much so
             I could fill the pacific ocean ten times over. My marriage is 
              dead in my wifes eyes. I chose to stand while she did not.
               There is much behind her decision, but all it boils down to 
                is unforgiveness on a Jesus scale. Which is fine in a way.
                 What I dont get is the justification for choosing this way.
                  I will elaborate the things I contributed to its demise in
                   a later post. Either way Ive been on a quest to change, 
                    and I asked God to lead the way. Its quite an 
                     interesting path and Ive had divine guidance the whole
                      way.
        </p>
        <p> So my wife left one night in early october. It started out with
             my eldest son being a kid and annoying his mother. I was in 
              the lounge playing a game to wind myself down as I was 
               stressed about the day. My wife was trying to get our 
                youngest to sleep in our marital bed and was feeding him.
                 She got up and disciplined our eldest. He was crying. I 
                  stopped what I was doing stormed down to the boys bedroom
                   and told my wife to get out. This did not go down well. 
                    I used colorful language but she refused to leave me to
                     sort our son out a different way. I lost my rag and 
                      went to pick up our youngest because he had started to
                       cry. Off back to the lounge to try and settle the boy
                        and rescue the night. But my wife followed me and 
                         refused to drop it. I had both kids at this point.
                          She attacked me about everything. I lost it now 
                           threw my laptop while holding our youngest. I 
                            nearly dropped him. But I caught him in time.
                             My wife became hysterical and called the cops
                              claiming I was being violent towards her and
                               that the kids were in danger. She lied right
                                in front of me. I directed my anger away 
                         from her and the kids. They were not in danger.
                       I was heart broken, I just wanted her out now.
                      She gathered up her stuff and left witg our boys.
                     It was hard to watch them go. For the next few days
                    I was a complete mess. It eventually led me to question
                   whether my job was worth my marriage. Because the stress
                  of running a farm seemed to be too much. I decided to 
                 leave and I was punished for it by a guilt tripping boss
                who tried to charge me for all kinds of bullshit he just
               thought up. I left with none of my holiday pay and threats
              from an asshole who admitted he did that to his last
             employee.
             So my good friends took me in and guided me for quite some 
            time. I got better little by little and started talking to 
           friends and then counselors. It was hard to admit the wrongs
          I had done. Even harder to forgive the wrongs done to me.
         I struggled particularly with blame I was receiving. I also
        felt abandoned by her and those who I considered friends. I felt
       very alone, the loss of my wife and my kids was too much and the 
      voices gained a foothold. I was miserable a lot of the time but it 
     spurred me to seek understanding of why I felt this way. During this
    time I would pour my eyes over the bible and constantly wait on the 
   lord. He would answer my prayers with scripture and direct me to the
  appropriate passage. Like I would ask what did he want me to 
 do? And the passage I would get was from the book of Hebrews
  about his laws to do with marriage, in particular, divorce. Then 
   I would get another one from the book of malachi about how he 
    hates divorce. And to reinforce it He would use more scripture
     to tell me to not give up. So now I was in a hard place to be,
      respecting my wifes decision and being obedient to Jesus.
       So I listened to God, but still accepted her decision. Its in
        Gods hands now, I just pray for her now. No expectations 
         towards her. But every expectation to my God to deliver.
