    <p>
      I have come to believe in multiple Dimensions. Why? God is why.
      God is said to be outside the realm of time, so by that statement
      it suggests there are is multiple areas of a given area. What does this
      mean? I believe it means that we exist in one area and God exists in
      another. Two completely different areas with different properties but also
      common properties which allow for interactions between both.

    <h4>On Gods Mathematical Formulae</h4>
    <div class="paragraph-answer2">
    <p>
      Now through hours upon hours of dilligent research, I have come across
      interesting formulae found in bible. To understand what I found is going
      take a lot of explaining. So do my best over the next few years to
      address this. The formulae is important because it helps to explaining
      how we can take the next steps to eliminating poverty, unlimited
      energy production and non-harmful communication to name a few. In the
      years to come I will show my findings here in this personal blog.

    <p>
      I thank-you the reader for taking the time to read this blog, I am sorry
      that I have not added any functionality for comments as I am still
      building this site as I am writing these blogs. I hope to publish a more
      user-friendly interactive site later on, but for now git pages will
      suffice and thanks to git hub for the use of this publishing system.
      Thanks to all who will be helping me with this Project as well.
      And most of all Thank You to God for his continued help in my life Amen.
